Git is a Version Control System (VCS) used for tracking changes in computer files.
It was created in 2005 by Linus Tovalds
It is a distributed version conrol system, which means many developers can work on the same project without having to be on the same network.
It cordinates work between multiple developers and tracks every single change that is made on the project or file
You can alway revert back or make changes to any project or file.
You can track who made changes to a project or file, what changes was made, and at what time the changes were made.
Some of the Basic Commands of Git are:
$ git init: for initializing local git repository
$ git add: This adds the file or files that you specify to the staging area & make them ready for commiting
$ git status: To see what you have in the stagin area, that is ready for commit
$ git commit: This commits your files. It takes everything in the staging area, and puts them in the local repository
$ git push: this is used to push your project or file to a remote repository e.g. Github.
